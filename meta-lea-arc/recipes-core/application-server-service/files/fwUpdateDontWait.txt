Starting in ARC firmware 2.0.2.43 a 4-minute wait time was added to the Blacktip firmware update process.  This is necessary for the -HV rail to discharge before asserting the power supply micro reset line.
Newer versions of firmware properly shutdown the LV supplies on the power supply and do NOT need to wait for the rail to dicharge.

If this file is present, it indicates the newer firmware is running and a wait is not required

If it is NOT present, then a ~ 4-minute wait is required before asserting the PS reset line.

This file is stored in the active partition.  Before starting a firmware update, one must look at the other partition for the presence of this file in order to know what to do.
